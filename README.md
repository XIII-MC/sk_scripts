# Skript Bin
Bunch of scripts including anticheats, mini-games, captchas, anti-bots, ect...
You can use some or all code as you wish, however please give me credits (even a little line as a commentary is good enough)

## DMCA

If there's one or more of your script in this repo please open an issue indicating the script with a proof of ownership (credits in the code, same code already released some time ago before here)

### Anticheats

In this skript bin there's MANY anticheats. This includes a lot of private/premium versions (that i coded).

You can find:
- Guard (Versions from 3-4y ago to the latest dev build)
- Anayo (A combat oriented anticheat that had both free & premium versions)
- AntiFisher (My fish private anticheat that i used on most my servers)
- Pentagon (Basicaly AntiFisher but renamed with a few new checks and fixes)
- DragonChaser (Again AntiFisher just under a different name)
- WatchDuck (The skript version of NoRules's anticheat that never got used since it was judged "too good" by the owners...)
- WatchCat (Anayo's big sister, made by an old friend: LegendaryOfCats)
- AAB (Not really an anticheat but an anti-bot, AAB was meant to mean "Advanced Anti Bot". Trust me it has nothing advanced it's really basic)

### Core scripts

Theres also many scripts caled "CORE.SK", they were the main script that had most thing a server would need and have such as punishments, autobroadcast ect...
There's scripts for some of my old servers like KnockiFFA, FishRoyale (A battle royale), FishFisher (a fishing server) or even ArUwO (was meant to be a 1:1 ArUwU copy, a old famous minehut pvp server)

You can find:
- KnockiFFA
- FishFisher
- FishRoyale
- ArUwO
- Duko (The main script for the Guard test server)

### Private scripts

I uploaded about ~85% of my scripts, i kept some private as i judged the code too "good" to really be published since i could maybe reuse it to remake it in Java.
If you like archerving things, please credit me for the scripts :). If you wish to use them again please credit me
